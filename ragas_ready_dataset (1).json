Contributing factors include age, individual foot anatomy, being overweight, and jobs or leisure activities that put repetitive stress on a person's foot. Risk factors: Age: Plantar fasciitis most commonly begins around the age of 40. Foot anatomy: People with flatfeet, high arches or alignment issues such as over pronation. Being overweight or obese: Extra weight adds stress to the feet. Occupation: Jobs that require long hours of standing or walking can stress feet over time, especially if you have other risk factors listed here. Exercise that puts stress on the heel that involves running, jumping and dancing. How do I know if I have plantar fasciitis? The plantar fascia is a ligament that connects the back of the foot to the front. Common causes of plantar fasciitis include: injury, overuse, inflammation, flat feet, high arches. Anyone can get plantar fasciitis, but activities such as running can increase the risk. If a person has plantar fasciitis, they often feel pain when waking up. The pain typically gets worse during waking hours with walking and standing. In addition to arch pain, a person may feel stiffness in the heel or ball of their foot. People with plantar fasciitis may need to stop engaging in activities such as running to let the foot heal. They can also consider wearing support shoes or using inserts to help take pressure off the arch. Cavus foot is a structural abnormality that causes a high arch.

The symptoms of a rotator cuff tear can include pain, weakness, and limited mobility in the affected arm, and may be diagnosed through a combination of physical examination, imaging tests (such as X-rays or MRIs), and medical history.

Stand only on the towel with the injured leg. Hold for 15 seconds. As your balance improves, increase that time up to 45 seconds. Return your uninjured foot to the floor. Perform this exercise 10 times in a row. When ready, increase the challenge by standing on more unsteady surfaces like a wobble board. Your physical therapist may also have you use a BAPS board (Biomechanical Ankle Platform System) while working on balance exercises. Exercises to Prevent Ankle Sprains Summary: After an ankle injury, you may benefit from ankle strengthening exercises. Your healthcare provider may send you to a physical therapist for this. You can progress from non-weight-bearing and ankle-strengthening exercises to partial weight-bearing exercises as you recover. You can move on to full weight-bearing and balance exercises as you gain strength. Use the chair as support at first, but it is important to work towards doing this activity with little or no support. This will increase the overall strength of the ankle. Once a person has mastered this, they can move on to more challenging balance exercises. Variations may include balancing on the healing leg while: moving the head from side to side, slightly bending and straightening the knee, the eyes are closed. These exercises are trickier to do, but they can help train the leg to balance properly. Gentle cardiovascular exercises: While it is vital to do workouts that specifically target the ankle, it is also important to find ways to strengthen and train the rest of the body. It is still possible to do some forms of cardio training while recovering from a sprained ankle. Proprioception (balance) training: Poor balance often leads to repeat sprains and ankle instability. A good example of a balance exercise is standing on the affected foot with the opposite foot raised and eyes closed. Balance boards are often used in this stage of rehabilitation. Endurance and agility exercises: Once you are pain-free, other exercises, such as agility drills, may be added gradually. Running in progressively smaller figures-of-8 is excellent for agility and calf and ankle strength. The goal is to increase strength and range of motion as balance improves over time. Once you are pain-free, resistance exercises may be added to your therapy program to strengthen the muscles around your ankle.

Your physical therapist can show you the difference between what a sprain and a strain is and how to properly treat each of these distinct injuries. Steve Debenport / E+ / Getty Images Muscle Strains Strains are injuries that affect muscles or tendons, the thick bands that attach muscles to bones. They occur in response to a quick tear, twist, or pull of the muscle. Strains are an acute type of injury that results from overstretching or over contraction. Pain, weakness, and muscle spasms are common symptoms experienced after a strain occurs. Ligament Sprains Sprains, Orthopedics Sprains & Strains What Is the Difference Between Sprains and Strains?

However, sprains differ in that they involve the stretching or tearing of a ligament, while strains involve the stretching or tearing of a muscle and/or tendon. Sprains and strains can also differ by their causes and the parts of the body they affect. Sprains are often caused by the twisting of a joint such as the ankle, knee, or wrist, while strains are often caused by the overuse or forceful impact of the neck, back, or hamstring. Even so, both can be treated with the RICE method, over-the-counter painkillers, and rehabilitation."],
        "answer": "A strain is an injury that affects muscles or tendons, resulting from overstretching or over contraction. A sprain, on the other hand, is an injury that affects ligaments, also resulting from overstretching or twisting. The main difference between a strain and a sprain is the location of the affected tissue. Strains occur in muscles or tendons, while sprains occur in ligaments. Additionally, the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of these injuries may differ slightly depending on the location of the affected tissue.",

        "contexts": ["Make the most of the available facilities. Stages of sports rehabilitation There are 3 recognized stages of rehabilitation and these are: Early-stage rehabilitation is gentle exercise allowing for the damaged tissue to heal. This stage is often rushed and will result in poor quality healing and will be prone to re-injury. Mid-stage rehabilitation involves progressively loading the muscles/tendons/bones or ligaments to develop tensile strength producing a healed tissue that will be able to withstand the stresses and strains of everyday life and exercise. Late – the final stage (late) of rehabilitation is where the tissue adapts and is stressed using functional exercises and drills to ensure the body is ready to return to play. Restoring muscle strength Restoring your muscles back to normal strength levels is an important principle of sports rehabilitation., Phase 1 Phase 1 is the acute stage and begins as soon as possible following injury. The aim of phase 1 is to reduce pain and inflammation and allow the muscle to heal. The emphasis is on rest and protection to enable healing to begin to take place. Phase 2 This is the early rehabilitation phase and aims to continue protecting the area as well as improve the condition of the muscles. Phase 3 Phase 3 is the mid-rehabilitation phase, further increasing groin muscle strength and endurance. Phase 4 The aim of phase 4 is to increase Groin muscle strength and endurance and prepare for a return to training/play. Phase 5 This is the late rehabilitation & return to full training phase. Phase 6 Here we return to your regular training routine now. Include the following exercises as integral components to prevent a recurrence of your injury. What’s included in the program? Treatment & healing, femoral stress fracture ,myositis ossificans,dead leg, and tumours. Recent studies also suggest that the location of the quadriceps tear determines how long the muscle will take to heal. Quadriceps stains can occur at the muscle surface (myofascial), the muscle belly, or the large tendon in the muscle (also called the central tendon). Muscle surface injuries quickly recover (3-4 weeks). In contrast, injury to the intramuscular central tendon has the worst outcome, leading to a longer time to return to sport (3-4 months).

Firstly, proprioception is often dampened or slowed down following an injury and needs to be re-trained, and secondly, some people have generally poor proprioception and they are significantly more prone to injuries.
