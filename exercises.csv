Box Squats,https://www.rehabhero.ca/exercise/box-squats,"BOX SQUATS
The Box Squat exercise is a great tool to use when learning how to do a squat or when learning how to do one correctly. The box is there as both a safety net to catch you if you fall (helping to build confidence) and as an external cue to tell you that you have squatted deep enough. For this exercise it is important that the butt simply taps the box and does not sit on it completely as shown in the video. Keep the spine neutral and feet in any distance apart that feels comfortable and natural. You can raise your arms up and forward to counter balance your hips moving backwards.

Your legs can be anywhere between hip and shoulder distance apart with the hips extended so that you’re in a bridge position. Be sure to maintain bench contact with your head, neck, and shoulders. Begin by gently lowering the hips towards the ground, dropping only as deep as tolerated by your back (do not push through pain, stick to pain free ranges of motion). Stay at the bottom position for up to 2 seconds and raise the hips back up to return the spin back to a neutral position.

Hip Sciatic Nerve Flossing,https://www.rehabhero.ca/exercise/hip-sciatic-nerve-flossing,"HIP SCIATIC NERVE FLOSSING
The hip sciatic nerve flossing exercise is used to mobilize the sciatic nerve to help reduce inflammation and peripheral nerve impingement. Generally this exercise is to be done in a pain free range of motion, if the end ranges are intolerable you can modify the exercise by moving through a smaller range of motion. Start by lying down on your back on a padded surface like a yoga mat. Keep both legs straight and parallel with the ground. With your target leg, raise it by flexing the hip while maintaining a straight knee and neutral ankle. Complete this movement while simultaneously going into cervical extension (looking up with your head). Once maximal tolerable and tension free range is reached, begin to lower the leg while raising the head off of the ground (into cervical flexion) to complete a repetition.

Rack Pull,https://www.rehabhero.ca/exercise/rack-pull,"RACK PULLS
The rack pull exercise is a exercise regression of the DEADLIFT that allows the reintroduction of lumbar extension. Start with a barbell placed on the L-Arms of a squat rack. Stand with your feet roughly hip distance apart and hands gripping the bar shoulder distance. Hinge at the hips until you are able to grip the bar and bend the knees to maintain a neutral spine. Stand over the bar so that it is directly below and in line with your armpit. Keep the core braced and latissimus dorsi engaged to increase lumbar stability during the movement. Lift the bar up by driving the feet into the ground and extending the hips and knees. Keep the bar as close to the body as possible during the entire lift. It is important to stand tall at the top of the movement instead of hyperextending the low back. Lower the weight until it rests on the L-arms by reversing the motion.

Hip CAR,https://www.rehabhero.ca/exercise/hip-car,"HIP CAR
The hip continuous articular rotation exercise is a multidirectional hip mobility exercise. You may hold onto a dowel, wall, or other stable surface to assist your balance during this exercise. Start by adducting the thigh by pulling the leg towards the midline of the body. While maintaining as much adduction as possible, raise the thigh up towards hip height allowing the knee to bend and the hip to externally rotate. Once at maximal hip flexion, begin to move the thigh outwards while maximally externally rotating the hip. Maintain maximal hip flexion as you do so. Eventually you’ll reach a point where you are unable to abduct the thigh any further, at this point begin to internally rotate the hip while maintaining as much flexion as possible. Then allow the hip to move into extension as you continue to internally rotate the thigh. Once at maximal hip extension and internal rotation, return the hip to neutral flexion without letting go of the internal rotation.
You have just completed half a repetition, to complete a full repetition you must reverse the motion. Internally rotated the hip while moving the thigh into hip extension. Once at maximal extension, begin to abduct the thigh by moving it outwards. Once at maximal combined internal rotation and abduction, begin to abduct further by externally rotating the thigh. Allow the hip to move into flexion while doing so. Once at maximal abduction and external rotation, begin to adduct the thigh while moving the hip into maximal flexion. Its important that at this point you are maintaining as much hip external rotation as possible. Continue to adduct the thigh until you’ve reach max adduction, flexion and external rotation. From there lower the leg back to neutral while still maintaining as much external rotation and adduction as possible. Complete a repetition once your leg has lowered back down towards the floor.

Clubbell Deadlift,https://www.rehabhero.ca/exercise/clubbell-deadlift,"CLUBBELL DEADLIFT
This is a modification of the CONVENTIONAL DEADLIFT that is used to train anti-rotation stability. Start with your feet roughly hip distance apart and hands gripping the handle of the clubbell horizontally. Hinge at the hips and bend the knees to maintain a neutral spine. Stand over the weight so that it is directly below and in line with your armpit. Keep the core braced and latissimus dorsi engaged to increase lumbar stability during the movement. Lift the weight up by driving the feet into the ground and extending the hips and knees. Keep the clubbell as close to the body as possible during the entire lift. It is important to stand tall at the top of the movement instead of hyperextending the low back. Lower the weight by reversing the motion but do not rest the weight on the ground. Instead stop lowering the weight after passing the knees and raise the weight up again to complete a repetition.

Ankle Sciatic Nerve Flossing,https://www.rehabhero.ca/exercise/ankle-sciatic-nerve-flossing,"ANKLE SCIATIC NERVE FLOSSING
The ankle sciatic nerve flossing exercise is used to mobilize the sciatic nerve to help reduce inflammation and peripheral nerve impingement. Generally this exercise is to be done in a pain free range of motion, if the end ranges are intolerable you can modify the exercise by shortening the range. This exercise is recommended to be completed on a padded surface like a yoga mat. Begin by lying down on your back with one thigh raise to 90 degrees hip flexion and supported with both arms. Extend the knee as much as you can without experiencing nerve tension symptoms. Keep the non-target leg straight and parallel with the floor. Floss the sciatic nerve by simultaneously looking up with your head while dorsiflexing (heel pointing towards ceiling) your raised foot. Once your maximal tolerable and tension free range is reached, plantarflex the ankle (toes pointing to ceiling) while looking down with your head to complete a repetition.

This is a modified version of CONVENTIONAL DEADLIFT that utilizes a wider stance to make the lift more quadriceps dominant. Start with your feet wider than shoulder distance apart and hands gripping the bar hip distance apart. Your feet may be externally rotated between 15 to 30 degrees. Hinge at the hips and bend the knees to maintain a neutral spine. Stand over the bar so that it is directly below and in line with your armpit. Keep the core braced and latissimus dorsi engaged to increase lumbar stability during the movement. Lift the bar up by driving the feet into the ground and extending the hips and knees. Keep the bar as close to the body as possible during the entire lift. It is important to stand tall at the top of the movement instead of hyperextending the low back. Lower the weight by reversing the motion.

Keep the core braced and latissimus dorsi engaged to increase lumbar stability during the movement. Lift the bar up by driving the feet into the ground and extending the hips and knees. Keep the bar as close to the body as possible during the entire lift. It is important to stand tall at the top of the movement instead of hyperextending the low back. Lower the weight by reversing the motion.

The pnf hip abductor stretch is a proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretch used to target the lateral hip muscles. Start by anchoring a strong pullup assist band to a stable anchor at roughly hip height. Lie down on your back on a padded surface with your foot looped through the free end of the pullup assist band. Lie down so that the band pulls your foot into a light hip adduction stretch and hold this stretch for 5-7 seconds. Then activate the hip abductors by pushing into the band’s resistance without overpowering it. Hold this muscle contraction for 5-7 seconds. Once again relax and allow the band to pull you into deeper hip adduction, repeating as required.

Shoulder Press + Shrug,https://www.rehabhero.ca/exercise/shoulder-press-shrug,"SHOULDER PRESS AND SHRUG
This is a modified shoulder press exercise that adds in an end range shrug to recruit the Upper Trapezius muscle. We want to recruit this muscle when it is tight because strengthening a muscle increases a muscle’s tolerance to stretch - helping with decreasing muscle tension. In this instance, we do not want to ‘keep the shoulders down and back’. This exercise is ideally performed with light weights only (<50% 1 RM or RPE).

Hinge at the hips and maintain straight knees to maintain a neutral spine. Keep the core braced and latissimus dorsi engaged to increase lumbar stability during the movement. Lift the kettlebell up by driving the feet into the ground and extending the hips. Keep the weight as close to the body as possible during the entire lift. It is important to stand tall at the top of the movement instead of hyperextending the low back. Lower the weight by reversing the motion.

This exercise is the exact opposite of a conventional plank. If a regular plank strengthens the abdominal and core muscles along the front of your body, the Chinese Back Plank will strengthen the muscles of the lower back and posterior chain. To do this exercise properly, make sure the spine is neutral and the core is braced and hips are in neutral. A common mistake is using the low back to hyperextend instead of using the hip and glute muscles to extend the hip into a neutral position (compensation pattern).

Irradiated Thoracic Rotations,https://www.rehabhero.ca/exercise/irradiated-thoracic-rotations,"IRRADIATED THORACIC ROTATION
This is a thoracic spine mobility exercise that gets you to squeeze a foam roller or yoga block between the knees to dissociate rotation motion from the lumbar spine. Start seated with foam roller or yoga block between your knees and squeeze it with a high amount of effort. Place both hands behind your head and proceed to rotate maximally to one side. Once there, use your contralateral (opposite) hand to push yourself deeper into rotation by 5-10 degrees. Hold this new position and let go with your hand and return it to behind your head. Hold this position for 5 seconds before slowly returning to rest position. Repeat on the same side until full range is achieved. Full range is achieved when you can not increase the amount of thoracic rotation even when using your opposite hand for assistance.

To ensure you are doing good form pay attention to the rotation of your pelvis - make sure it stays squared forward during the entire movement (you should not be rotating the pelvis). Additionally, only lightly tap the wall with your hip, and do not lean your weight into the wall. Pretend the wall is made out of rice paper that will rip with the lightest amount of tension applied to it. This exercise gets more difficult the slower you do it. Aim for a controlled tempo of 4 seconds moving towards the wall, hold briefly and take 4 seconds to return to starting position. This exercise will also train single leg leg stability and balance.

Isometric Wrist Pronation,https://www.rehabhero.ca/exercise/isometric-wrist-pronation,"ISOMETRIC WRIST PRONATION
This exercises uses a kettlebell to provide rotational stress to the wrist and forearm muscles. Pin a rolled up towel or yoga block between your elbow and body to help isolate the forearm muscles.

Supine Side Kick Slider,https://www.rehabhero.ca/exercise/supine-side-kick-slider,"SUPINE SIDE KICK SLIDER
The supine side kick slider exercise uses the floor to assist in isolating the hip abductor and extensor muscles. This exercise also helps to dissociate hip abduction from lumbar lateral flexion. This exercise requires a slider disc (a towel may be used on hard flooring instead of a disc, or a paper plate on carpet). Start by lying down on your back on a padded surface. Place one heel on a slider disc. Press downwards into the floor with your heel to compress the disc. Keep the core braced to maintain a neutral spine. While maintaining downward pressure, begin to abduct your thigh by sliding the disc away from the body. Be sure to limit the movement to the hip by stopping before the pelvis tilts laterally. Hold the end position for up to 2 seconds before returning back to a neutral position.
